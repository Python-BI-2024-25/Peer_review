"""
The utility for working with DNA and RNA and of
filtering FASTQ sequences.
This utility provides two main functions:
1. Operations on the transmitted DNA or RNA sequences:
transcription, reversing, complementing, reversing
complementing, identifying the molecule type.
2. Filtering FASTQ sequences in FASTQ file
based on GC-content, length and quality score.

Modules:
1. module_rna_dna_tools: contains the operations on the
transmitted DNA or RNA sequences.
2. module_filter_fastq: contains functions to calculate
sequence properties: GC-content, length
and quality score.

    This utility filter a file of FASTQ sequences
    based on GC content, sequence length, and
    quality threshold.
    Criteria for filtering:
    1. GC-content: sequences must fall within the
    specified GC range.
    2. Length: sequences must fall within the specified
    length range.
    3. Quality threshold: sequences must fall within
    the specified quality.

    The input FASTQ file path containing
    the sequences to be filtered.

    The output FASTQ file path where filtered
    sequences will be saved.
    :param gc_bounds: tuple[float, float] | float = (0, 100):
    A tuple containing the lower and upper bound of the
    GC content percentage.
    If a single value (float) is provided, it will be used
    as the upper bound and 0 as the lower bound.
    Default value is (0, 100).
    :param length_bounds: tuple[int, int] | int = (0, 2**32):
    A tuple containing the minimum and maximum length
    of the sequence.
    If a single value (int) is provided, it will
    be used as the maximum length and 0 as
    the minimum length. Default value is (0, 2**32).
    :param quality_threshold: float = 0:
    Contain the minimum average quality score of the sequence.
    Default value is 0, which means no quality score is considered.
    :return: None: The function writes the filtered sequences
    directly to the specified output FASTQ file.
    Raises:
    FileExistsError: If the output file already exists,
